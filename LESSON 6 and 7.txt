<h1>The Teenage Years</h1>
‹p><font class-"Typo1" >
We learn from our mistakes,<br> From the wrong turns we take, ‹br> From the fake friends we make, <br> And from the times we almost break.<br><br>
Our mistakes help us grow,<br>
But at the time, we didn't know.<br>
We didn't want our weakness to show.<br> At the time, we couldn't let them know.<br> </font></p> </body> </html>
